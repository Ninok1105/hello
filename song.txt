Hear what I wanna say:
One day the time will come to pay
And forever fly away
When the waves erase my name
Ocean coast is still the same
Only sand will fly away
Jump from nowhere
In the air
And fly away, fly away
We will fly away, fly away
We will rise much higher
Sky's a liar
But fly away, fly away
We will fly away, fly away
